# Bacteria-Adaptation-Model
This is a Netlogo project that models the slow adaptation of different types of bacteria when exposed to gradually increasing amounts of anitbiotics (Homogeneous)  over time.
To use this project, open the BacteriaModel with NetLogo and make sure to put the sxl-utils library into the libraries section of NetLogo, the sxl-utils file is used for simple pathing of all the entities within the NetLogo model.
The project is still capable of running without sxl-utils with some minor modification but at a suboptimal level.
